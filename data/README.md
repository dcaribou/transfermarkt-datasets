# ‚ùì how to populate the data folder
This folder contains all raw and prepared data from the project. However, being this a [dvc](https://dvc.org/) repository, Github does not store the data itself but a reference to it, which is stored S3.

Checkout the [data storage section](https://github.com/dcaribou/transfermarkt-datasets#-data-storage) in the root README for instructions about how to pull the data from remote storage into your local machine.
