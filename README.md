# transfermarkt-datasets

In an nutshell, this project aims for three things:

1. Acquiring data from the transfermarkt website using the [trasfermarkt-scraper](https://github.com/dcaribou/transfermarkt-scraper).
2. Building a **clean, public football (soccer) dataset** using data in 1.
3. Automating 1 and 2 to **keep assets up to date** and publicly available on some well-known data catalogs.

## üì• setup

> **üîà New!** &rarr; Thanks to [Github codespaces](https://github.com/features/codespaces) you can now spin up a working dev environment in your browser with just a click, **no local setup required**.
>
> [![Open in GitHub Codespaces](https://github.com/codespaces/badge.svg)](https://codespaces.new/dcaribou/transfermarkt-datasets/tree/master?quickstart=1)

Setup your local environment to run the project with `poetry`.
1. Install [poetry](https://python-poetry.org/docs/)
2. Install python dependencies (poetry will create a virtual environment for you)
```console
cd transfermarkt-datasets
poetry install
```
Remember to activate the virtual environment once poetry has finished installing the dependencies by running `poetry shell`.

### make
The `Makefile` in the root defines a set of useful targets that will help you run the different parts of the project. Some examples are
```console
dvc_pull                       pull data from the cloud
docker_build                   build the project docker image and tag accordingly
acquire_local                  run the acquiring process locally (refreshes data/raw/<acquirer>)
prepare_local                  run the prep process locally (refreshes data/prep)
sync                           run the sync process (refreshes data frontends)
streamlit_local                run streamlit app locally
```
Run `make help` to see the full list. Once you've completed the setup, you should be able to run most of these from your machine.

## üíæ data storage
All project data assets are kept inside the [`data`](data) folder. This is a [DVC](https://dvc.org/) repository, so all files can be pulled from remote storage by running `dvc pull`.

| path        | description                                                                                                                                                                     |
| ----------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `data/raw`  | contains raw data for [different acquirers](https://github.com/dcaribou/transfermarkt-datasets/discussions/202#discussioncomment-7142557) (check the data acquisition section below) |
| `data/prep` | contains prepared datasets as produced by dbt (check [data preparation](#-data-preparation))                                                                                             |

## üï∏Ô∏è data acquisition
In the scope of this project, "acquiring" is the process of collecting data from a specific source and via an acquiring script. Acquired data lives in the `data/raw` folder.

### acquirers
An acquirer is just a script that collect data from somewhere and puts it in `data/raw`. They are defined in the [`scripts/acquiring`](scripts/acquiring) folder and run using the `acquire_local` make target.
For example, to run the `transfermarkt-api` acquirer with a set of parameters, you can run
```console
make acquire_local ACQUIRER=transfermarkt-api ARGS="--season 2024"
```
which will populate `data/raw/transfermarkt-api` with the data it collected. Obviously, you can also run [the script](scripts/acquiring/transfermarkt-api.py) directly if you prefer.
```console
cd scripts/acquiring && python transfermarkt-api.py --season 2024
```


## üî® data preparation
In the scope of this project, "preparing" is the process of transforming raw data to create a high quality dataset that can be conveniently consumed by analysts of all kinds.

Data prepartion is done in SQL using [dbt](https://docs.getdbt.com/) and [DuckDB](https://duckdb.org/). You can trigger a run of the preparation task using the `prepare_local` make target or work with the dbt CLI directly if you prefer.

* `cd dbt` &rarr; The [dbt](dbt) folder contains the dbt project for data preparation
* `dbt deps` &rarr; Install dbt packages. This is only required the first time you run dbt.
* `dbt run -m +appearances` &rarr; Refresh the assets by running the corresponding model in dbt.

dbt runs will populate a `dbt/duck.db` file in your local, which you can "connect to" using the DuckDB CLI and query the data using SQL.
```console
duckdb dbt/duck.db -c 'select * from dev.games'
```

![dbt](resources/dbt.png)

> :warning: Make sure that you are using a DukcDB version that matches that [that is used in the project](.devcontainer/devcontainer.json).


### python api
A thin python wrapper is provided as a convenience utility to help with loading and inspecting the dataset (for example, from a notebook).

```python
# import the module
from transfermarkt_datasets.core.dataset import Dataset

# instantiate the datasets handler
td = Dataset()

# load all assets into memory as pandas dataframes
td.load_assets()

# inspect assets
td.asset_names # ["games", "players", ...]
td.assets["games"].prep_df # get the built asset in a dataframe

# get raw data in a dataframe
td.assets["games"].load_raw()
td.assets["games"].raw_df 
```

The module code lives in the `transfermark_datasets` folder with the structure below.

| path                           | description                                                   |
| ------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `transfermark_datasets/core`   | core classes and utils that are used to work with the dataset |
| `transfermark_datasets/tests`  | unit tests for core classes                                   |
| `transfermark_datasets/assets` | perpared asset definitions: one python file per asset         |

For more examples on using `transfermark_datasets`, checkout the sample [notebooks](notebooks).

## üëÅÔ∏è frontends
Prepared data is published to a couple of popular dataset websites. This is done running `make sync`, which runs weekly as part of the [data pipeline](#-orchestration).

* [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/davidcariboo/player-scores)
* [data.world](https://data.world/dcereijo/player-scores)

### üéà streamlit
There is a [streamlit](https://streamlit.io/) app for the project with documentation, a data catalog and sample analyisis. The app ~~is currently hosted in fly.io, you can check it out [here](https://transfermarkt-datasets.fly.dev/)~~ deployment is currently disabled until [this](https://github.com/dcaribou/transfermarkt-datasets/issues/297) is resolved.

For local development, you can also run the app in your machine. Provided you've done the [setup](#-setup), run the following to spin up a local instance of the app
```console
make streamlit_local
```
> :warning: Note that the app expects prepared data to exist in `data/prep`. Check out [data storage](#-data-storage) for instructions about how to populate that folder.

## üèóÔ∏è [infra](infra)
Define all the necessary infrastructure for the project in the cloud with Terraform.

## üéº orchestration
The data pipeline is orchestrated as a series of Github Actions workflows. They are defined in the [`.github/workflows`](.github/workflows) folder and are triggered by different events.

| workflow name            | triggers on                                                  | description                                                                                                   |
| ------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `build`*                  | Every push to the `master` branch or to an open pull request | It runs the [data preparation](#-data-preparation) step, and tests and commits a new version of the prepared data if there are any changes |
| `acquire-<acquirer>.yml` | Schedule                                                     | It runs the acquirer and commits the acquired data to the corresponding raw location                                                                      |
| `sync-<frontend>.yml`    | Every change on prepared data                                | It syncs the prepared data to the corresponding frontend                                                                                |

*`build-contribution` is the same as `build` but without commiting any data.

> üí° Debugging workflows remotelly is a pain. I recommend using [act](https://github.com/nektos/act) to run them locally to the extent that is possible.
