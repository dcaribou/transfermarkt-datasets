### What does it contain?
The dataset is composed of multiple CSV files with information on competitions, games, clubs, players and appearances that is automatically updated **once a week**. Each file contains the attributes of the entity and the IDs that can be used to join them together.

For example, the `appearances` file contains **one row per player appearance**, i.e. one row per player per game played. For each appearance you will find attributes such as `goals`, `assists` or `yellow_cards` and IDs referencing other entities within the dataset, such as `player_id` and `game_id`.
> **Idea:** Chekout the mate [data.world project Football Data from Transfermarkt](https://data.world/dcereijo/player-scores-demo) for examples of how to use the resources in this dataset to create different types of analysis.

### How did we build it?
