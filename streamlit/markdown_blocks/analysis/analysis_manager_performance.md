This analysis amis to show which managers exhibit the best performance in their careers. The peformance indicator in this case is the win percentage (`pct_win`).

The win percentage is calculated looking at the team performance, mostly based on the `club_games` asset, and it's displayed across seasons and competition types (domestic or international).
